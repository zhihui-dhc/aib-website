Tomorrow - finish revamp of the hompage. Update the design and navigation of the lower sections to be more usable.

# 2016-09-05

* functionality fixes for the ToC and footer, which overlap
* improved the robustness of the ToC code
* design experiment with removing color and increasing contrast

# 2016-09-02
* Implemented working location tracking for the FAQ/Whitepaper.
* For larger displays, the table of contents also scrolls with content on the FAQ/Whitepaper pages.

There is a caveat on the Whitepaper page. The h4 headings under TMSP Specification in the Appendix are not listed in the table of contents, which breaks the location tracking. I understand why they aren't listed in the ToC, because it would make the ToC much longer for just a few small sections. What I've done is turned the h4s into h5s just for that section.

Todo for next week: I want to improve the ToC for mobile. Crowdfund page design improvements. Better blog design + rss feed. Bug stomping.

Also have to fix an issue in Firefox with the use of nested lists in the ToC.

# 2016-09-01
## General
* Visiting the Plan/FAQ/Whitepaper pages again via the top navigation no longer resets the page position.
* Added a link icon next to h2/h3/h4 in the Plan/FAQ/Whitepaper. Clicking on them adds the url to your clipboard.
* Fixed an issue where visiting pages with hashes. http://localhost:8080/whitepaper#federated-name-resolution-system now scrolls you to the right place. Also cleaned up the effect of hashes on browser back history.
## Table of Contents
* Increased the clickable area for Table of Contents for easier mobile browsing.
* Hiding the ToC now centers the main page content.
## Whitepaper
* Under "Cosmos Overview", added "Tendermint-BFT DPoS" and "Governance" to the Whitepaper ToC.
* Fixed the `Merkle tree & proof specification` ToC link.
* Linked to the website version of the the Plan under the "Roadmap" section.

Also started on a 'YouAreHere' widget for the longer pages. This will also include a cookie to save the user's current position on the Whitepaper.

# 2016-08-31
Added a script to generate Vue-compatible HTML posts (and associated page routing) from Markdown files.
* Edit the blog posts in `./src/posts/`
* Build the blog only with `npm run blog`, or everything with `npm run build`
* The generated Vue/HTML files are stored in `./src/components/blog/`

I've re-enabled the `Blog` link on the site header for easy testing. Feel free to delete the Markdown files and start putting in blog posts. Be sure to add the YAML meta data to each `.md` file or the script won't work correctly. I've added more info to the readme too.

Regarding the `app.js` size issue: the file is much smaller when it's minified. With `npm run build` and serving the `./dist` directory, `app.js` is only 172kb without gzip.

Future stuff: add a RSS feed for the blog, blog design, ToC updates

# 2016-08-30
